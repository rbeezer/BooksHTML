The purpose of this project is to produce HTML versions
of textbooks that look good in a browser and on an iPad,
and which make better use of the capabilities of the web.
This involves:

1) A script which converts the author's source files (which
are written in LaTeX) to HTML.

2) Knowls and other enhancements, automatically generated
from the LaTeX source.

3) CSS to make it look good.

The initial focus is on Beezer's Linear Algebra,
Guichard's Calculus, and Judson's Abstract Algebra.

Because of differences in the structure of the underlying LaTeX
sources, each book will require different conversion scripts, at
least initially.  One outcome of this project should be best
practices for structuring the underlying LaTeX.  Then the
sources of each book can be refactored and processed
from a common script.

Even with separate conversion scripts, one CSS should work
for all three books.  The similar appearance of the three books
will bring attention to this project.
