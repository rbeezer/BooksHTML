MathJax and LaTeX Macros Example
Rob Beezer
2012/08/21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of macros from the source for "A First Course in Linear Algebra"
(http://linear.pugetsound.edu) both in their original LaTeX form and as
adapted to be usable with MathJax.

These macros were designed to allow a user to consistently change
notation throughout the book, though they can also be taken as a
sort of semantic markup of the source.

These are correct and usable at the time of posting, but will
not necessarly be maintained.

Contents of both of these files were available under the GFDL
at the time they were posted here.
